We are a group of Analytical Chemists who are passionate about application of Data Science and High Resolution Mass Spectromtery (HRMS) for unravelling the human and environmental exposome. 

We build digital Machine Learning (ML) tools to process LC/GC-HRMS data generated from complex samples from environmental to biological. Our tools are built following the **FAIR** Principals and made publicly available with MIT license.
