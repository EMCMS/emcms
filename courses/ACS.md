#### Course Information

In this course the mathematical theory of univariate and multivariate statistics (e.g. PLS-DA, Random Forrest classification, and Hierarchical Clustering) as well as modelling (e.g. PCA and MCR-ALS) and optimization will be discussed. A suite of statistical tools, from data pre-processing to multivariate modeling strategies, will be discussed during the lectures. The students will be encouraged to generate their own implementations of the learnt statistical tools in a high-level programming language such as [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).

Moreover, students will learn how setup data exploration and analysis workflows through a course long project, which will result in individual reports.

This course is coordinated by Dr. Samanipoure and consists of 11 lectures and tutorials and will take place during period five (i.e. April-May). For additional information, please get in touch via [s.samanipour@uva.nl](s.samanipour@uva.nl)
