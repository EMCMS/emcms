title: "EMCMS presenting at International workshops on LC-MS/MS in environmental analysis and food safety (Barcelona)"
---

**Dr. Samanipour** and **Denice van Herwerden** presented at the [LC-Ms/Ms2022](https://lcmsms.activacongresos.com/) meeting in Barcelona, Spain. 

**Denice** talked about her new fragment alignment analysis where she tries to find the connection between the experimental conditions (i.e. collision energy) and the generated fragments. Her tool will give us a better way of matching spectra coming from different instruments.

}

**Saer** on the other hand, presented an *in silico* tool for selection of the chemicals that can be potentially analyzed via RP-LC-HRMS. This tool is meant to provide another database filtering strategy to minimize the number of false identifications.

In the meantime we also managed to have fun!
